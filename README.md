## Description

This project aims to provide organizations with a reliable and efficient solution for tracking attendance and managing absenteeism. With the Attendancy-track app, you can easily monitor the presence of employees, students, or any other attendees within your organization. The app offers a range of features to streamline the process, including real-time updates for instant visibility, email notifications to keep everyone informed, and secure authentication using JWT tokens.

One of the key features of the app is the ability to apply attendance using QR codes. Attendees can simply scan a unique QR code assigned to them, and the app will instantly record their attendance. This eliminates the need for manual data entry and ensures accurate and efficient attendance tracking.

Additionally, the app provides live updates as attendees scan their QR codes. You can see attendance records being populated in real-time on the screen, providing immediate feedback on the presence of attendees. This feature enables you to monitor attendance progress during events, meetings, or classes and make timely decisions based on the attendance data.

By leveraging the power of QR codes and real-time updates, the Attendancy-track app simplifies the attendance tracking process, reduces administrative effort, and enhances overall efficiency for organizations of all sizes.
